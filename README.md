# Community-Security-Scheduler-for-neighborhood-watch
It sounds like you have a detailed project description in mind for a Community Security Scheduler. This project involves creating a web application using Node.js and Vue.js, integrating Google Maps APIs for mapping and location services, as well as WhatsApp API for verification and registration. Here's a breakdown of the key features and modules you're looking to implement:

### User Management:
- Registration with Email and SMS/WhatsApp verification.
- User approval workflow with different status levels (pending approval, disabled, enabled).
- User attributes such as qualifications, skills, and personal details.
- Activity log with IP tracking and login timestamps.

### Security Map Positioning:
- Display Google Maps with marked perimeter.
- Mark specific locations with different flags (entry points, security problems, guard points).
- Clickable points to view rosters and assign/remove users from schedules.
- Alert notifications for any schedule changes.
- Admin ability to assign users to shifts and points of interest.

### Map of Area with Static Locations:
- Mark static locations on the map.
- Clickable security guard points leading to scheduling interface.
- Create shifts and assign users to schedules.
- Admin control to manage shift assignments.

### Additional Functionalities:
- User roles with varying permissions (Super Admin, City Admin, Neighborhood Manager, User).
- Detailed user profiles with zoom-in functionality.
- Security problem reporting feature.
- Real-time alerts for admin-level actions.

### Technologies:
- **Backend:** Node.js for server-side development.
- **Frontend:** Vue.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **APIs:** Google Maps APIs for mapping and location services, WhatsApp API for verification/registration.
- **Database:** You might need a database system (like PostgreSQL) to store user data and scheduling information.

### Next Steps:
1. **Planning:** Create a detailed project plan with tasks, milestones, and deadlines.
2. **Development:** Start developing the backend and frontend components based on the outlined features.
3. **Testing:** Thoroughly test all functionalities, including user registration, map integration, and scheduling features.
4. **Deployment:** Deploy the application on a web server and ensure it's accessible to all users.
5. **Feedback:** Gather feedback from users and stakeholders for further improvements.

Remember to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and consider version control (e.g., Git) to track changes in your codebase. Good luck with your project! If you have specific questions or need help with particular aspects of development, feel free to ask.
